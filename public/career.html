      <p>In an ever-changing, increasingly complex world, it's more important than ever that our nation's youth are prepared to bring knowledge and skills to solve problems, make sense of information, and know how to gather and evaluate evidence to make decisions. These are the kinds of skills that students develop in science, technology, engineering, and math, including computer scienceâ€”disciplines collectively known as STEM/CS. </p>

        The job I would want to pursue, would be the one will pay me a great sum and give me joy. Along with the job fitting with my intro, I would want to be come either a software engineer or a computer scientist. These job are pretty similar thought, but there is a difference in that a computer scientist does more hardware related stuff than a software engineer.
