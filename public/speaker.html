      <h2>Why he was good!</h2>
      <p>Even though Mr. Johnson was very late for the meeting, he delivered. And, by far, he's been the most entertaining and the most relatable. You see, I also want to do what he is doing; being a full-stack developer is something that sounds exciting. Working with the web is also something I like doing, and making websites that are cool and function right is really dope. I looked at his <a target="_blank" href='https://github.com/rtjohnson0'>github</a>, and it has many advanced projects that I really want to know how he did them. Also, his story shows how he never gave up, never let his parents down, never played around, and never deserted his dream. Was very touching and kind of inspired me to just keep pushing and never give up.
