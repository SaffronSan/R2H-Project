      <p>I have had a pretty good experience in road to hire. So far the class has, been entertaing and educating enough to point where I would activly wait for third block. Also, it has taught me some new skill in note taking, I didn't know there were types of note taking, after I learned about this skill, my noting taking has gotten so much more better.</p>
