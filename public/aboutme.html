I have been living in Charlotte for the majority of my life and want to continue because It's a pretty good place to live. I have lived on both sides of Charlotte, and so far I like living on the east side since it's less crowded and just more interesting. I can still speak Nepali, not perfectly, but well enough for a native speaker to understand me. I can also write my name in Nepali, which shouldn't be that impressive, but the writing system there isn't like Latin and is pretty difficult.

        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <p>So what I like doing in my free time is to play chess and get beter at the game. Even though, this game is super old like over 2000 years, it still has some of its hidden charm. The game doesn't have dlc, battle pass, and the character are pretty well balanced, expect for the queen which need to get nerfed. But the game does have some cons, cheating, like there has been a lot of

          in this game and it's really hurting the player base. So that's something that the devs need to work on more.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>So back in middle school my social study teacher played the famous

          clip where they defend against the persians. This moment forever change my view in history, because I always thought of it has boring and dull, never could have I thought that it would get this exicting. After this I always took learning about history more serious, and I have read so far a couple of books regarding history, my latest was one about

          Finding new infomation about histoical facts always intrigue me since we learn some new about the past, which something that is always exciting.</p>
        <h2>Memes</h2>
        <p>Now, this sounds silly but for the last 6 months I have been studying the ways of the internet. Like what I would do is go old websites like 
          <a target="_blank" class = "" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/">know your meme</a> and just start to read everything and learn about popular meme. This may sound weird, but it actually fun, plus I got too learn a lot about how the web worked, since knoyourmeme is a like a wiki and references other sites including long dead websites. One of the websites I was looking at, was called pya.cc, now I wanted to figure out the infamous 
          <span class = "dropup">
            <a class = '' data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">jeff the killer</a>

          orgins. And <a target="_blank" class = "" href="https://pya.cc/">pya.cc</a> was one of the first website that this creppy photo could have came from along side /b/, since the orgin of this image is pretty much lost. But back to pya.cc, this website now just shows you random reddit videos, but back then, using the waybackmachine I learned of how much of an impact this site had to the modern internet. You, won't believe what I saw, this old site use to be the hub for trollers and hackers trying to anoying people in various ways. Reading memes wikis, made love the web again since I got to learn about the old interent which was a wild time, I mean anything went as said. You had hackers groups such as

          fighing everyone from ISIS to child predtaors, they shut down many website in order to make the web safer. They even went against a whole church, scientology and mass a gaint global protest standing for science and freedom of speech.</p>
        <h2>Web</h2>
        <p>Now I think its pretty obious that I like making stuff on the web, the only reason is why though was because of MS.G. She was my computer scinece teacher last year, and she gave me a project where I had make an website kinda like this, before I didn't have interest of the web. But after I figure how htm, css, and js all work togather I was amazed and needed to know more. I have made some funky looking wesbite before, you find in the other section, but one of them I want highlight is my form website. Now, I google form is alright, but it could better I thought, so I tried to make a "better" version of it. The expermient didn't went too well, as it ended up taking too long to make the create form side and I couldn't decide on various choices such as stroing issues, publising issues, etc. But this project was big because before I never took one my ideas and turn it into something, and making the website was jolly fun, as I learn a lot about js.</p>
